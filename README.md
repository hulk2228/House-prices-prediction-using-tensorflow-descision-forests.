Cats vs. Dogs Image Classification using TensorFlow
This notebook demonstrates a binary image classification task to differentiate between images of cats and dogs using TensorFlow. It includes data augmentation, model building, and evaluation on the "Cats and Dogs" dataset. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for effective image recognition.
